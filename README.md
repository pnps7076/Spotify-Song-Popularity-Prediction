# Spotify-Song-Popularity-Prediction using Multiple Linear Regresion
Determine how well the features explain Popularity of songs on Spotify and Predict Popularity of a song based on these features

Spotify is an audio streaming application that needs no introduction. Over the span of 14 years, it has reached 286 million active users and 130 million premium subscriptions. An average user listens to Spotify for 25 hours a month, 44% of the users dance with their souls through this app on a daily basis. This clearly suggests that for a significant part of the world, Spotify is the go-to address for music.

In this project, we tried to, list the most popular artists, investigate the kinds of music we are listening to the most, and genre behaviors over the years while questioning the genre definitions. And ultimately predicting the song's popularity.

For this analysis, we have used the Spotify Dataset 1921-2020 that contains over 160 thousand tracks, gathered by fellow Kaggler Yamac Eren AY, using Spotify Public API.
